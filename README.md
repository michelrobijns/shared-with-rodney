# Hey!

So when you first run it, it will generate a 'mean absolute percentage error' of about 50% and I can't get it to do significantly better than that... 50% feels like a lot to me, especially because I'm trying to have the model overfit the data.

I already have some ideas about what the problem might be, but feel free to give it a try!
